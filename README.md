# *Hi there* 👋

- **About me:** My name is Lauren, I am a 23 year old student currently enrolled in my first year of university at the University of South Wales, studying a BSc with honours degree in computer science.
  
- **Hobbies:** I have a passion for video games and their development, my favourite games include The Last of Us and the Silent Hill series. I began playing video games in early childhood, and my love for them has followed me throughout my life, which sparked my interest in technology and code. I enjoy learning languages in my spare time. I am currently improving my previous Welsh language skills and learning how to speak and read Japanese. I also enjoy playing instruments as a hobby, my skills include piano, guitar and ukulele.
  
- **Skillset:** I am able to use Python, and I am currently learning how to program in C++.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, SQL, cryptography. Whilst learning cryptography at university, we evaluated different cryptographic methods such as the Caesar and Vigenère cipher and covered their real-world uses. We also covered how to develop entity relationship diagrams as database concept models.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on programs in C++ and HTML projects.

## ***Recent projects completed:*** 

⦁	**Monthly income** - A program that calculates the total monthly income of an employee by increasing the basic monthly pay by the percentage of bonus and medical allowance pay.

⦁	**Height in meters** - A program that converts the height inputted by the user from feet and inches into meters.

⦁	**Annual high temperatures** - A program that calculates the average temperature of 3 cities if the temperature rose by 15%.

⦁	**How much paint** - A program that calculates the area of a fence that is 6ft tall and 100ft wide, and tells the user the number of paint tins needed to paint the fence.

⦁	**Burger stall** - A program that calculates the total profit of a burger stall in a day, by asking the user to input the amount of sales of each type of burger.

⦁	**Project hours** - A program that uses user input of days spent to calculate the total amount of time two people spend on a project, which is then displayed in hours and minutes.

⦁	**House budget** - A program that takes in data regarding monthly expenses and uses the data to calculate the annual cost of each expense.

⦁	**Coin toss** - A program that simulates a random coin toss, allowing the user to guess heads or tails to win.

⦁	**Area of triangle** - A program that requests 3 lengths of the sides of a triangle from the user, checks for validity and calculates the area of the triangle.

⦁	**Rainfall** - A program that reads information from a file to calculate the total and average rainfall amounts between 2 months.

⦁	**Distance travelled** - A program that allows the user to input a vehicle's speed in mph and hours travelled, then displays the distance travelled in a table that breaks down the distance by each hour.

⦁	**Weight conversion table** - A program that displays a table with imperial tons converted into pounds and kilograms in increments of 2, starting with 2 and ending with 20 tons.

⦁	**Average speed** - A program that uses two input distances with two corresponding times to calculate the average speed in km/h.

⦁	**Student Performance** - A program that uses a class to receive and store information about a student and their academic scores. This program then calculates performance using a formula of 75% academic score and 25% extracurricular score to determine the student's overall grade. This program used loops to ensure that inputted scores were valid, and stored the student's personal information in a private class.
