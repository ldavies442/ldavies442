# *Hi there* 👋

- **About me:** My name is Lauren, I am a 23 year old student currently enrolled in my first year of university at the University of South Wales, studying a BSc with honours degree in computer science.
  
- **Hobbies:** I have a passion for video games and their development. I began playing video games in early childhood and my love for them has followed me throughout my life, which sparked my interest in technology and code. I enjoy learning languages in my spare time, I am currently in the process of improving my previous Welsh skills and learning how to speak and read Japanese. I also enjoy playing instruments as a hobby, my skills include piano, guitar and ukulele.
  
- **Skillset:** I am able to use Python, and I am currently learning how to program in C++.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, SQL, cryptography. Whilst learning cryptography at university, we evaluated different crypograthic methods such as the Caesar and Vigenère cipher and covered their real world uses. We also covered how to develop entity relationship diagrams as database concept models.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on programs in C++ and HTML projects.

- **Rainfall** - Program that reads information from a file to calculate the total and average rainfall amounts between 2 months.

- **Distance travelled** - Program that allows the user to input a vehicles speed in mph and hours travelled to display the distance travelled using a table which breaks down the distance through each hour.

- **Weight conversion table** - Program that displays a table with imperial tons converted into pounds and kilograms in increments of 2, starting with 2 and ending with 20 tons.

- **Average speed** - Program that uses two inputted distances with two corresponding times to calculate the average speed in km/h.

- **Student Performance** - Program that uses a class to recieve and store information about a student and their academic scores, this program then calculated the performance using a formula of 75% academic score and 25% extra curricular score to then find the overall grade of the student. This program used loops to ensure that inputted scores were valid, and stored the students personal information in a private class.
